# cmto

A cli to create an ease of collaboration among developers

## What is this?

`cmto` is a command-line application that aims at making new huge codebases familiar to move around for new developers joining in.

## How to use it?

You can create new `cmto-keys` and leave them in code in the form of comments. When other developers need to move around the code-base, they can use `cmto` from the command line itself to see what piece of code lies where.

## How would I set this up for development?

Install `cmto`

```sh
npm run install-cmto
```

Test by running CLI

```sh
cmto
```
